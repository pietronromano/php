## SandboxUsage
1. cd into a `sandbox` sub-directory:
   ```bash
   cd php-from-scratch/sandbox/finished/01-variables-data-types/01-php-tags-printing-comments
   ```

1. Run a PHP file directly from the terminal:
   ```bash
   php index.php
   ```

5. Run a local development server:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
   Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

**NOTE:** Fortunately, Laragon's virtual host setup doesn't interfere with the simple PHP built-in server usage, which can be run from any folder, even with the same port as Apache.
